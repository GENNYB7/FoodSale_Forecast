Predict the sales of food items thought several stores.

Exploring the data structure and addressing missing and 0 values

Replacing columns values for uniform data

Started with visualizations to better undertand data.

Distribution of target variable shows skwed data.

Most popular items are: Fruits and Veggies, Household, followed by Snack and Frozen foods.

The less visible and item the more expensive per oour graph.

Not much diference between medium and high outlet sizes.

it has relative correlation with item's list price.

Location and size of the store has the largest impact on sales. and the higher positive correlation.

Arrange data for ML.
